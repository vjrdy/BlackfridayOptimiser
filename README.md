# BlackfridayOptimiser

In recommender systems, considering a matrix of user ratings for movies, matrix factorisation infers the latent characteristics of the movies and the affinity of users for each of them. Applications include signal decomposition, where a matrix of signals is decomposed into a set of base components along with a mixing matrix. This lower rank approximation relies on an approximation of the latent factors and thus offers an insight on the problem.

The dataset here is a sample of the transactions made in a retail store. The store wants to know better the customer purchase behaviour against different products. Specifically, here the problem is a regression problem where we are trying to predict the dependent variable (the amount of purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables.

Classification problem can also be settled in this dataset since several variables are categorical, and some other approaches could be "Predicting the age of the consumer" or even "Predict the category of goods bought". This dataset is also particularly convenient for clustering and maybe find different clusters of consumers within it.

Optimiser is demonstrated on three classifiers such as
            i. Gradient Descent
           ii. Stochastic Gradient Descent
          iii. Mini Batch Gradient Descent
